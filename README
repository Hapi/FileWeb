----------------

Usage: java -jar fileweb.jar [-? | -h | -help | --help | --version]
       java -jar fileweb.jar [PORT [NUM_OF_THREADS]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'fileweb' is a small web server for publishing a file system over (local) net. 'fileweb'
is useful if there is a resource to be shared over (local) net. For example, if a file
need to be copied to another computer (with another operating system) 'fileweb' and wget
together saves your day.

Web root directory will be the directory where 'fileweb' was started. 

'fileweb' recognises several filetypes but if that is not enough it can be modified.
fileweb.jar has 'application-xml.conf' and 'plain-text.conf' files which contains file
endings to be recognised as 'application/xml' and 'plain/text' MIME types respectively.
Additionaly if the file is recognised as zip, jar, war or ear file then a browser shows
a small eye symbol in the front of the file name. By clicking the eye the user can peek
the content of the packed file.

If the visual appearance does not feel right it can be changed by modifying CSS stylesheets
and images which are in css/ and img/ folders inside of fileweb.jar.

'fileweb' also has some informative JMX attributes.
